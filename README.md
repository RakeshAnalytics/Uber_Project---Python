# Uber_Project---Python
In this project, I analyzed Uber pickups data by importing  20 CSV files using Python. The goal was to understand hourly, daily, and monthly patterns of Uber rides in New York City. The data was cleaned, merged, and visualized using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for actionable insights.
